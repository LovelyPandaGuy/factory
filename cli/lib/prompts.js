## What the repo already shows

${brief}

## What the person said

${personBlock(context.answers)}

## The job

## Write the spec here

\`${target}\`

Fill every section of this template from the repo and the job line. Replace every
placeholder.
${context.lane === "quick" ? `\n${QUICK_LANE}\n` : ""}
${template}

## Rules

- Do not ask the person anything now. Decide from the code and the job line.
- Where you had to guess, start the line with \`Assumed:\`. The person reads every one
  before approving.
- Put only the decisions the person must make under Open questions, at most five.
- Every acceptance check must be provable by a machine from a known state, and names its
  proof. "Sending..." on screen is not proof; the result on the other side is.
- Prove acceptance checks with the project's tests (run by the factory) or with something a
  reviewer can see by reading the code. The factory runs the tests, build and checks and
  records the evidence itself. Do not make an acceptance check out of git chores (staging,
  committing, tags) or out of evidence files someone must produce by running commands:
  committing is the person's job after the review.
- If the repo already does part of this, say so and reuse it.
- No code, no plan, no task list.
- Plain language. British/South African spelling. Dates as YYYY-MM-DD.
- Return one line when the file is written, and nothing else.

## The approved spec

${specText}

## Write the plan here

\`${target}\`

Fill in this template. Replace every placeholder.

${template}

## Additional rules

- Walk the reuse ladder in the constitution. Say what already exists and why it was or was
  not used. If you propose a substantial new component, say why rungs 1 to 6 failed.
- State the schema, every index and what it is for, and what would be painful to change
  once real people are in it.
- State who can read or write each thing, where secrets live, and what personal data is
  stored, why, and for how long.
- The plan must not add a state the spec did not answer. If the spec is missing something,
  stop and say what is missing.
- Every acceptance check in the spec gets a row in "One check per acceptance check".
- Plain language. Dates as YYYY-MM-DD.
- Return one line when the file is written, and nothing else.

## The approved spec

## The plan

## Write the task list here

\`${target}\`

Fill in this template. Replace every placeholder.

## Additional rules

- Every task is a reviewable change with an exact file path.
- Every task says what proves it: \`Proves: <the check that shows the outcome>\`.
  A task whose proof is "it looks right" is not a task.
- Proves: lines name tests or the factory's checks. Do not ask for evidence files made by
  running commands, and do not make staging or committing a task; the factory records the
  evidence and the person commits after the review.
- The last task is: the factory's checks pass.
- Order by risk: the uncertain part first, not last.
- Plain language. Dates as YYYY-MM-DD.
- Return one line when the file is written, and nothing else.

## The job

${idea}
${failureBlock}
## How to work

- Work through the tasks in order. Tick a box only when its proof passes.
- Small changes. Walk the reuse ladder before writing anything new.
- Run the project's own tests and build as you go.
- Never leave a secret, key or password in a file.
- If the job touches personal data, say what data, why, and where it is stored.
- Do not add a dependency if the project already has a way to do it.
- If something is unclear, ask one question and stop. Do not guess.

## When you believe it is done

Stop. Do not announce success. As soon as you finish, the factory runs the project's tests,
build and checks itself (\`factory verify --deep\`) and decides. If you are not allowed to
run commands here, that is expected: do not ask the person to run them, and do not list
commands for them. Say in a few lines what you changed, what you ran, and anything only the
person can do (for example, changing a leaked key).

If a check fails, you will be given the failure and asked to fix it.
